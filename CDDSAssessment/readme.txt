This solution contains 3 different projects: Custom Containers, Sorting Algorithms, and the Graphical Game Project.
Visual Studio will be needed to inspect the full functionality of the containers and algorithms, as it cannot be fully proven through the console window.
The graphical game, made with Raylib, can run on its own via the .exe file.
The game involves the player clicking on the screen to shoot bullets at various aliens flying through the air, while using A and D to dodge enemy bullets.
The player then tries to achieve the highest score they can by destroying the aliens.
